<summary> 1. What are the different data structures in R?  </summary>
<br/>

Broadly speaking these are Data Structures available in R:
* Vector - A vector is a sequence of data elements of the same basic type. Members in a vector are called components.
* List	- Lists are the R objects which contain elements of different types like âˆ’ numbers, strings, vectors or another list inside it.
* Matrix - A matrix is a two-dimensional data structure. Matrices are used to bind vectors from the same length.  All the elements of a matrix must be of the same type (numeric, logical, character, complex).
* Dataframe - A data frame is more generic than a matrix, i.e different columns can have different data types (numeric, character, logical, etc). It combines features of matrices and lists like a rectangular list.
